Marshalls Revenue Forecasting Application
Overview:
Built a C# console application that simulates revenue forecasting for a service-based business. The application transforms operational job volume inputs into projected financial outputs using structured pricing logic and conditional analysis.

Key Functionality:
Captures projected interior and exterior service volume via console input
Implements pricing model:
Interior murals → $500/unit
Exterior murals → $750/unit

How It Works
User inputs the number of scheduled interior and exterior murals.
Program computes revenue per category.
Outputs total revenue and indicates which service type has higher volume.

Calculates:
Revenue by service category
Total projected revenue
Performs comparative service distribution analysis using conditional logic
Outputs formatted business insights to the console

Technical Concepts Demonstrated: 
Object-oriented structure in C#
Console I/O handling
Control flow (if/else conditions)
Arithmetic computation and variable management
Basic business logic modeling
